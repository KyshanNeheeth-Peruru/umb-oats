# Umb-oats

Setting up:-
Once the project is cloned, go to the directory where there is manage.py file.
Create a virtual environment anywhere (not required but recommended) and then activate it.
Then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all the required packages.
Then you can use "python manage.py runserver" to start the application in your local.

Thank you.
